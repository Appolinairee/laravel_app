# post product
# factorize newCreatorOrProduct Notification for admins
# put product


# delete product
# get products
# get product
# get products by category
# get products by creator

# creator is real creator when his status is 1: else he should attempt to admin verfication




















## Let's think this

# request to restore account: from user only :: post user/restore  ::: admin
# restore user route ::: admin
#  admin only can restore account
# style welcome notification and other notifications
# Day format, date should be format in api directly

# message and notify admins for creating creator and product: for its authentification
# admins should made creator status to 1


#how to send json format? We want to store json attrribut (such as caracteristics, delievering, ...) as text, should api receive json to transform to text, or the client should format json to text before send it?

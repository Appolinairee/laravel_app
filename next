# PUT /creators/{id}
# GET /creators/{id}/products









## Let's think this

# restore user route

# who can get user? For moment, all connected user. But we should make admin and own user only. 
# who can update user profile? For moment, it's user only, but we can include administrator
# who can delete user profile? For moment, it's user only, but we can include administrator
